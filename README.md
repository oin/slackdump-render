This project generates HTML files for each channel and private discussion in a Slack workspace from a [`slackdump`](https://github.com/rusq/slackdump) archive.

# Visual Studio Code setup

To use the tasks configured in this project, you need to set the `test.dumpdir` variable in your Visual Studio Code settings. This variable should point to the directory where your Slack dump is located.
